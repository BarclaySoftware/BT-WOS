# Chosing which version to use
Every version of WebTerminal or BT-WOS has its own unique commands or design. If you are looking for simple designs and commands, then you should build upon Jupiter WebTerminal v0.1. If you are looking for a traditional DOS-like design and commands, then build upon Barclay WebTerminal v1.6. If you want a more modern design and commands, then build upon BT-WOS v2.6.

# Protecting the legacy
Even though these projects are only a few months old, each version is built off the back of the previous ones. It would be much appreciated if, in your variation of WebTerminal or BT-WOS, you keep refrence to whichever version you are using, either by including the project name or a link to this repo.
